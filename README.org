Ralisk it's an [[https://archlinux.org][Arch Linux]] installation script design to be fast and simple.

For doing that ralisk install and configure the minimum elements necessarys to have a functional OS, that means that you will get almost nothing at all, internet access, vi, and [[file:./TANGLE.org][some other stuff]], but escencilly a black screen. You can change this and some other things by modifying the [[file:./config][config]] and [[file:./packages][packages]] files.
